## GitHub Notifications Preview (same page pop-overs) | Chrome Extension (WIP)

#### Things it offers:
- Allows to preview the unread notifications using pop-overs looking exactly like the ones on the right (profile and new-repo)
- Allows to perform actions like marking as read and unsubscribing on the notifications 

#### Few things to know:
- I'm yet to upload it to the chrome store
- I'm new to making open-source contributions so feel free to suggest me how to do things better :)
